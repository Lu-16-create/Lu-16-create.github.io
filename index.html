                <p class="text-white-50">
                    In times long past there was a city, which was besieged by a
                    dragon. As no other sacrify satisfied it, even the king’s daughter
                    was sent to it. But it didn’t go.</p>

                <p class="text-white-50">
                     Then George, a brave knight, appeared. He crossed to the island
                    where the dragon lived, and in a hard fight he wounded it so badly,
                    that he was able to take it alive to the city. Impressed by this deed,
                    many citizens converted to Christianity, George’s religion. This
                    displeased the king, who adhered to paganism, and he executed
                    George. Therefor he is called a martyr.</p>

                <p class="text-white-50">
                    The true story. A parody by Jürgen Eckey
                    I cheated. I am no hero. I admit that I’m rightly punished. But why
                    with death? Can’t they just let me go? It would be enough to
                    deprive me of all these honors, which I don’t live up anyway, and
                    to chase me out of the city in disgrace, where I can no longer
                    show my face!</p>

                <p class="text-white-50">
                    When I arrived, there was already big fear. A dragon! A dragon! A
                    dragon was up to mischief in front of the city. The hysteria was
                    enormous.</p>

                <p class="text-white-50">
                    The princess had been offered to the dragon as a “voluntary”
                    sacrifice to put it to rest. Because the king found no help, the
                    anger of the citizens turned against him and he should give his
                    daughter to feed the dragon.</p>

                <p class="text-white-50">
                    You have to explain to me why a princess tastes different from a
                    middleclass girl? And no dragon gets enough just from a
                    princess! But she had been escorted in a funeral procession to
                    the beach and was crossed over to the island where it had it’s
                    nest. And she was not seen again.</p>

                <p class="text-white-50">
                    But the evil was not over. The dragon was still there. So a hero
                    was sought to kill it. I just had big problems with some ladies
                    who, not without a matter, asked me to marry them. That’s why
                    I signed up for this impossible mission to get rid of them.</p>

                <p class="text-white-50">
                    As a former soldier I indeed was able to play the role of the
                    fortified fighter! I let myself be put in a fine armor and was
                    taken to the boat with the sympathy of the whole population. –
                    My plan was to circle the island and escape, unseen by the city.</p>

                <p class="text-white-50">
                    So why did I end up on the island? Quite simply, because of the
                    princess! I can’t resist any woman. And not only had she
                    survived, she lived peaceful side by side with the dragon!</p>

                <p class="text-white-50">
                    With her fluteplaying she had calmed and tamed the beast!</p>

                <p class="text-white-50">
                    Soon we were a couple. She was as passionate as a woman,
                    which lived long time alone, can be. She showed me her garden.</p>

                <p class="text-white-50">
                    With her fluteplaying she had calmed and tamed the beast!</p>

                <p class="text-white-50">
                    Soon we were a couple. She was as passionate as a woman,
                    which lived long time alone, can be. She showed me her garden.</p>
                    She was so smart!

                <p class="text-white-50">
                    She had even trained the dragon to hunt for her! With plenty of
                    meat and some fruits and vegetables we had a good food on
                    the island. We could live like in paradise.</p>

                <p class="text-white-50">
                    But we both were missing human society. So we made a plan
                    for our return: She would be graciously received back at the
                    court of the king and I, as her savior, would be her husband and
                    a high officer in the royal army!</p>

                <p class="text-white-50">
                    We had a problem with the dragon. It didn’t want to stay alone
                    on his island, but followed the princess like a puppy! No matter
                    how much we shooed it or yelled at it, it could not be driven
                    away. So we let it come along, even though we knew it was not
                    in his interest.</p>

                <p class="text-white-50">
                    Of course, for both of us the dragon’s presence offered the
                    possibility of a triumphant homecoming!</p>

                <p class="text-white-50">
                    My princess walked in front, playing the flute, luring the dragon
                    after her. It obediently tripped behind, looking right and left
                    nervously because of all the people. I walked behind the dragon,
                    moving menacing my spear as if I were it’s tamer. No words can
                    describe the jubilation!</p>

                <p class="text-white-50">
                    The marriage was celebrated in all splendor. But on the
                    wedding feast table there was – dragon tongue! And indeed I
                    was put in a high command of the army. It was like in a fairy
                    tale. But unfortunately I’m not a fairy tale man!</p>

                <p class="text-white-50">
                    Getting drunken in nice company after weeks of virtuous life as
                    a noble knight – who can describe this feeling! As a dragon
                    slayer, my chances with women were well now and I used them
                    where I could. I even embraced Christianity to seduce a pretty
                    noble lady!
                    Must I mention that I was not able to fulfill my boring military
                    duties?</p>

                <p class="text-white-50">
                    My little princess was very angry about me. But what she could
                    do – I thought.</p>

                <p class="text-white-50">
                    She ran to her father, the king, cried to him and he decided to
                    punish me for my new religion. Not for adultery, that is private;
                    but for Christianity as a religion, which doesn’t respect the king,
                    not to cast a shadow on the kings daughter.</p>

                <p class="text-white-50">
                    Punished to death! This can’t be true! I am waiting for the
                    moment, that the door to my dungeon opens and my princess’
                    sweet voice whispers: “Hush! George, come!”
